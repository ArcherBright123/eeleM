# eeleM: Backward Melee
Backwards Super Smash Bros Melee. The Tier list is flipped on its head with the Worst (Bowser, Kirby) Becoming ABSOLUTELY BROKEN and the Best (Fox, Shiek) Becoming dogsh*t.
This will include the rom. 
It is a legally obtained rom from my physical copy of Melee. If you have any ideas, please feel free to post them.

The worse the character, the better they become.
The Better the character, the worse they become.
In Progress. Still a long way to go. Many More Buffs and Nerfs will be added to each character

# Bowser changes:

Pros:
+ Good recovery
+ Up air is now 4x faster
+ Flame breath now covers the WHOLE STAGE and deals 20% per flame (Way too broken, pressing B can deal 500%. Holding it can deal 999% and eventually kill after taking the opponent to the blastzone)
+ Jab poisons
+ INFINITE Jumps.
+ Side B Throw Instakills

Cons:

- Can SD while using flame breath (Always could, but is a tiny bit more frequent, only a tiny nerf for all the bullshit he gets)
