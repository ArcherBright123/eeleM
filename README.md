A competitive version Might be created (eventually, if i feel like it), this is the casual version (AKA the True Broken Version)


Backwards Super Smash Bros Melee. The Tier list is flipped on its head with the Worst (Bowser, Kirby) Becoming ABSOLUTELY BROKEN (One hit KO or instakill type shit) and the Best (Fox, Shiek) Becoming dogsh*t. Other characters will get Buffs and nerfs for their corresponding tiers. This IS NOT for competitive play. This is WAY TOO UNBALENCED. It is good to troll your Melee fan or to troll people with. Also fun to Fuck around with in single player. I Am thinking of adding new characters though.

I probably will make a more balanced version of this in the future.

# Kirby and Bowser should are BROKEN. Only use them as a LAST RESORT.

# Shadow the HedgeHog Is In Development!

This will include the rom. 
It is a legally obtained rom from my physical copy of Melee. If you have any ideas, please feel free to post them.

The worse the character, the better they become.
The Better the character, the worse they become.
In Progress. Still a long way to go. Many More Buffs and Nerfs will be added to each character

# Bowser changes (Warning: InstaKill Moves)

Pros:
+ Good recovery
+ Up air is now 4x faster
+ Flame breath now covers the WHOLE STAGE and deals 20% per flame (Way too broken, pressing B can deal 500%. Holding it can deal 999% and eventually kill after taking the opponent to the blastzone)
+ Jab poisons
+ INFINITE Jumps. (Going to nerf. Maybe 5 max with endlag)
+ Side B Throw Instakills

Cons:

- Can SD while using flame breath (Always could, but is a tiny bit more frequent, only a tiny nerf for all the bullshit he gets)





# Kirby Changes (Warning: InstaKill Moves)
